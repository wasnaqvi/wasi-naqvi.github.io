### Introduction.
Hi, I'm a third year Physics and Data Science Major, primarily interested in Astronomy. I am passionate about using computational methods to solve problems in Physics. When I am not behind a computer screen, I am on a soccer field.
I also like classical literature, poetry, and Hozier.


### Work Experience
**Undergraduate Research Assistant @ Centre for Optimization, Convex Analysis and Nonsmooth Analysis(COCANA) Lab**

**Data Analyst for the Stratospheric Balloon Experiment Team @CAN-SBX**

# Projects

1. **Finding Exoplanets using TESS**
   - Jupyter Notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/wasnaqvi/Projects/blob/e8f102bee628d42406da7042044751cf4f78ed64/Astronomy/Finding_Analyzing_Exoplanet.ipynb)

2. **Stacking and Handling NGC 891 FITS files from Hubble Space Telescope Data**
   - Jupyter Notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/wasnaqvi/Projects/blob/e8f102bee628d42406da7042044751cf4f78ed64/Astronomy/FITS_Handling_and_Stacking.ipynb)

3. **Plots, Plots, Plots, and Plots**
   - This notebook contains (yes, you guessed right) plots. From Hertzsprung Russell Diagrams to Population Growth Curves, This is just a random assortment of(yes I will say it again) plots.
   - Jupyter Notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/wasnaqvi/Projects/tree/0c6010eb5ecb9215ce9f61cc53966a44fd37dd6c/Misc)

4. **Investigating Myopia in children - A Machine Learning Approach**
   - Utilizing a classification model to analyze the myopic (nearsighted) study1 dataset, which comprises 554 children enrolled in the Orinda Longitudinal Study of Myopia (OLSM). Baseline data from the third grade were evaluated to develop a predictive profile for later onset of juvenile myopia.
   - The Program,written in R,can be found [here](https://github.com/wasnaqvi/Projects/tree/80d8f7a1a7b0bf187cdb2804af3ed29103ec2ad7/Machine%20Learning)
   
5. **Using Numerical Methods in Stellar Structure (Coming soon)**
