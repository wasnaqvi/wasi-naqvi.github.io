### Introduction.
Hi, I'm a third year Physics and Data Science Major, primarily interested in Particle Physics and Astronomy. I am passionate about using computational methods to solve problems in Physics. I am also passionate about building and designing experiments. When I am not behind a computer screen, I am on a soccer field.
I also like classical literature, poetry, and Hozier.


### Work Experience
**Junior Research Scientist @ National Research Council, Herzberg Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Victoria**

**Undergraduate Research Assistant @ Centre for Optimization, Convex Analysis and Nonsmooth Analysis(COCANA) Lab**

**Data Analyst and Team Member for the Polarization Stratospheric Balloon Experiment Team @CAN-SBX**

# Projects
1. **Numerical Simulations of the Stellar Structure Model for Solar Mass and Massive Stars**
   - This study intended to compare the stellar models for massive 8 M⊙ stars to 1M⊙ stars.The models
     yield physical parameters for these Zero Age Main Sequence Stars via numerically solving the Stellar
Structure Equations.A Runge-Kutta 45 Method is implemented with step size h = 1000 to obtain the
key parameters. Based 
off of the values obtained,a comparative analysis of the flux generated is presented. The Study further
probes into flux generation by providing a reasonable estimate of the solar neutrino flux generated
from fusion inside the core of the Sun

1. **Stacking and Handling NGC 891 FITS files from Hubble Space Telescope Data**
   -  Imaging stacking Andromeda's NGC 891 to produce some beautiful rgb images from FITS files. Confirmed stacks using SAO DS9.
   - A Tutorial-Style Jupyter Notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/wasnaqvi/Projects/blob/e8f102bee628d42406da7042044751cf4f78ed64/Astronomy/FITS_Handling_and_Stacking.ipynb)
     
2. **Finding Exoplanets using TESS**
   - Using a combination of lightkurve,astropy, and numpy to probe Kepler and TESS data, using the transit method to find Exoplanets.
   - A Tutorial-Style Jupyter Notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/wasnaqvi/Projects/blob/f85bf1c755b30397f9e87ca8d69ead7c4f96bb33/Astronomy/Finding_Exoplanets%20(1).ipynb)

3. **Plots, Plots, Plots, and Plots**
   - This notebook contains (yes, you guessed right) plots. From Gaia EDR3 Data to Population Growth Curves, This is just a random assortment of raw (yes I will say it again) plots.
   - Jupyter Notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/wasnaqvi/Projects/tree/0c6010eb5ecb9215ce9f61cc53966a44fd37dd6c/Misc)

4. **Investigating Myopia in children - A Machine Learning Approach**
   - Utilizing a classification model to analyze the myopic (nearsighted) study1 dataset, which comprises 554 children enrolled in the Orinda Longitudinal Study of Myopia (OLSM). Baseline data from the third grade were evaluated to develop a predictive profile for later onset of juvenile myopia.
   - The Program,written in R,can be found in two parts, [here](https://github.com/wasnaqvi/Projects/tree/f85bf1c755b30397f9e87ca8d69ead7c4f96bb33/Machine%20Learning) and [here](https://github.com/wasnaqvi/Projects/blob/f85bf1c755b30397f9e87ca8d69ead7c4f96bb33/Machine%20Learning/Myopic_Study%2BSalary_Analysis.Rmd)

5. **Ongoing Projects**
   - I am working on two projects right now. One project is a generalizable software pipeline for detector simulations. This will hopefully be out by this August. I am also working on an exciting projects to implement an M-Sigma Clustering Algorithm to investigate Mass Segregation in Globular Clusters.
