### Education
-Undergraduate Physics and Data Science Student

### Work Experience
Undergraduate Research Assistant @ Centre for Optimization, Convex Analysis and Nonsmooth Analysis(COCANA) Lab
-I used the YALMIP solver, converted code between MATLAB and Python-writing unit tests to verify. The Python code is commercially being used by SoftTree Inc.
-Used Python to improve the pipeline between the existing projects at the Lab and the current commercial work being done.

Stratospheric Balloon Team @ CAN-SBX
Physics and Data Science Lead
-Using Micropython and C++ to write an efficient implementation for microcontrollers used in the Faraday Rotation experiment.
-Data Analysis with Python, currently in the processes of designing a machine learning model that will predict atmospheric data for our experiment.
-Analog Electronics, Circuit Analysis. Assisting the Engineering Team with circuit theory and uncertainty analysis

   - Jupyter Notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/wasnaqvi/Projects/blob/e8f102bee628d42406da7042044751cf4f78ed64/Astronomy/FITS_Handling_and_Stacking.ipynb)

4. **Cross Matching Gaia's EDR3 data with NASA's Exoplanet Archive**

   

5. **Investigating Myopia in children - A Machine Learning Approach**
   - Utilizing a classification model to analyze the myopic (nearsighted) study1 dataset, which comprises 554 children enrolled in the Orinda Longitudinal Study of Myopia (OLSM). Baseline data from the third grade were evaluated to develop a predictive profile for later onset of juvenile myopia.
   - The Program,written in R,can be found [here](https://github.com/wasnaqvi/Projects/tree/80d8f7a1a7b0bf187cdb2804af3ed29103ec2ad7/Machine%20Learning)
