  <h1>My Research</h1>
  <p>
    I am a first year graduate student at the Trottier Space Institute at McGill University.
    I work on exoplanets with a focus on Bayesian modelling for population-level studies. I am
    passionate about using computational methods to solve problems in physics and using
    rigorous statistics to tackle fun questions.
